      <h2>Explination</h2>
      <p>This started from an interview question asking me to count groups of 1's in a text file of 0's and 1's.</p>
      <p>Initiall I used the Depth First Search algorithm written in JavaScript using a Docker container with Node.js
        and
        that got me very curious about the efficiency of other algorithms</p>
      <p>I created several node and python scripts also designed to be run in Docker and output the number of seperate
        groups of 1's found, the duration of the execution, and the memory used.</p>
      <p>From there I thought it would be really cool to actually see the traversal through this grid of numbers.</p>
      <p>This is still a work in progress and it's not really what I initially envisioned, but it does at least provide
        an
        animation of the shapes being found.</p>

      <p>The Expected number of shapes would be 2. The 1's are only considered connected if they are above, below, left,
        or right. Diagonals are not counted.</p>
