# Why

Each script utilizes a different algorithm to solve the problem. This allows for testing the results against each other as well as checking the performance of each.

## Docker Usage

- First build the desired image 
  - node: `docker build -f Dockerfile.node -t maestro-shapes-node .`
  - python `docker build -f Dockerfile.python -t maestro-shapes-python .`

### Depth-First Search (DFS) 
- Run the Node DFS script with small data: `docker run --rm maestro-shapes-node node dfs.js data_small.txt`

```

## Client Animation Usage

This was an attempt to make a visualization of how each algorithm traverses the grid.
It isn't functioning as I had hoped yet.

I'll host a version of the app [here](https://codecurio.us/grid-traversal/)

Install dependencies `npm install`

Build the production bundle running `npm run build`

For Development use `npm run start`
